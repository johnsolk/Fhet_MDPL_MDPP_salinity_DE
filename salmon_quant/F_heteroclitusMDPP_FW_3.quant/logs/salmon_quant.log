[2017-07-08 23:52:37.874] [jointLog] [info] Counted 12001523 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-07-08 23:52:37.890] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000780702% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
