[2017-07-08 23:38:54.069] [jointLog] [info] Counted 12633154 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-07-08 23:38:54.085] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00039805% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
