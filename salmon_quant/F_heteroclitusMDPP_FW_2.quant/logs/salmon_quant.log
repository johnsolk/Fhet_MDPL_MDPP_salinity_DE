[2017-07-08 23:49:55.341] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7114692 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-07-08 23:49:55.353] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000445874% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
