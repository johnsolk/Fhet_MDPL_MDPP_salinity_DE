[2017-07-08 23:59:36.671] [jointLog] [info] Counted 9807085 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-07-08 23:59:36.689] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000613609% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
